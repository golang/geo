// Polygon represents a sequence of zero or more loops; recall that the
// interior of a loop is defined to be its left-hand side (see Loop).
//
// When the polygon is initialized, the given loops are automatically converted
// into a canonical form consisting of "shells" and "holes".  Shells and holes
// are both oriented CCW, and are nested hierarchically.  The loops are
// reordered to correspond to a preorder traversal of the nesting hierarchy.
//
// Polygons may represent any region of the sphere with a polygonal boundary,
// including the entire sphere (known as the "full" polygon).  The full polygon
// consists of a single full loop (see Loop), whereas the empty polygon has no
// loops at all.
//
// Use FullPolygon() to construct a full polygon. The zero value of Polygon is
// treated as the empty polygon.
//
// Polygons have the following restrictions:
//
//  - Loops may not cross, i.e. the boundary of a loop may not intersect
//    both the interior and exterior of any other loop.
//
//  - Loops may not share edges, i.e. if a loop contains an edge AB, then
//    no other loop may contain AB or BA.
//
//  - Loops may share vertices, however no vertex may appear twice in a
//    single loop (see Loop).
//
//  - No loop may be empty.  The full loop may appear only in the full polygon.
