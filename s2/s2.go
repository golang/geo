// About centroids:
// ----------------
//
// There are several notions of the "centroid" of a triangle. First, there
// // is the planar centroid, which is simply the centroid of the ordinary
// (non-spherical) triangle defined by the three vertices. Second, there is
// the surface centroid, which is defined as the intersection of the three
// medians of the spherical triangle. It is possible to show that this
// point is simply the planar centroid projected to the surface of the
// sphere. Finally, there is the true centroid (mass centroid), which is
// defined as the area integral over the spherical triangle of (x,y,z)
// divided by the triangle area. This is the point that the triangle would
// rotate around if it was spinning in empty space.
//
// The best centroid for most purposes is the true centroid. Unlike the
// planar and surface centroids, the true centroid behaves linearly as
// regions are added or subtracted. That is, if you split a triangle into
// pieces and compute the average of their centroids (weighted by triangle
// area), the result equals the centroid of the original triangle. This is
// not true of the other centroids.
//
// Also note that the surface centroid may be nowhere near the intuitive
// "center" of a spherical triangle. For example, consider the triangle
// with vertices A=(1,eps,0), B=(0,0,1), C=(-1,eps,0) (a quarter-sphere).
// The surface centroid of this triangle is at S=(0, 2*eps, 1), which is
// within a distance of 2*eps of the vertex B. Note that the median from A
// (the segment connecting A to the midpoint of BC) passes through S, since
// this is the shortest path connecting the two endpoints. On the other
// hand, the true centroid is at M=(0, 0.5, 0.5), which when projected onto
// the surface is a much more reasonable interpretation of the "center" of
// this triangle.
